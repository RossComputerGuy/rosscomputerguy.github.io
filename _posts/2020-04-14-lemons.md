The saying "making lemonade out of lemons" is a meaphore to turn your problems into something good. My perfect life in 10 years will be one where I'm doing computer programming as a career. I'll be driving some sort of van with computers inside. I'll have gone to Oregon Tech as post high school. I want to live somewhere in Washington or near Portland.

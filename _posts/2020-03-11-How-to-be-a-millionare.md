Winning the lottery is an option but near impossible. But being productive is a way to become a millionare. Showing up early to work and staying late allows you to do more which in turn gives better grades/more money. Going to college allows you to make more money by giving you more opportunities. You can become a manager without college but that's only entry level. College opens more optios, trades can also be professional and an option.

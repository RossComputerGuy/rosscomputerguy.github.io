This trimester, I worked a lot on an operating system called RonixOS. Over the summer, I'm going to continue development and launch the cloud service I plan to have users to store their files on. I write a lot of bash scripts for helping and figured out how to use CMake for compiling things. My C programming skills got better so I know more about error handling and memory management.

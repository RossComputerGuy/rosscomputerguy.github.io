I’m Triplex, also known as Tristan Ross and formerly called Spaceboy Ross, I’m a high school student from the Pacific Northwest in the United States. I do lots of programming and YouTube, the latter is less frequent due to school. I also go camping with Boy Scouts which is fun even though I’m aging out this year, I hope to continue to be involved. My daily driver operating system is Arch Linux and it’s the first rolling distro I’ve ever used. The top three things everyone needs to know about me are that I love girls who are tomboy a lot, I wear trenchcoats a lot, and I do a lot of programming.
